title: Day 3 - Working From Home
---

Nothing I'm not used to with online school.

- My first day doing my internship remote. Woke up and got right down to it.
- Haven't asked anything yet. Kent sent me an API I can play with using GraphQL yesterday. Let me play around with it in the morning.
- Spent a little time setting up the Github and the SSH keys etc.. Corporate guides on the website are very helpful.
- Spent a bit of the afternoon setting up my [Github Pages](https://www.git.ouryahoo.com/pages/tpi01/tpi01.github.io/). Took way longer than I wanted to to install Jekyll understanding how the hosting actually works, but I'm glad I have this up so I can keep track of my progress.

## Research into ApolloGQL

## Server

1: Use **Data source** classes to encapsulate fetching data from the backend. They are equivalent to private getter functions. The `dataSources` option in the server is a function returning instances of our API subclasses.

```js
// index.js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  csrfPrevention: true,
  cache: "bounded",
  dataSources: () => {
    return {
      moviesAPI: new MoviesAPI(),
      personalizationAPI: new PersonalizationAPI(),
    };
  },
});
```

```js
// movies-api.js
const { RESTDataSource } = require('apollo-datasource-rest');

class MoviesAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  constructor() {
    // Always call super()
    super();
    // Sets the base URL for the REST API
    this.baseURL = 'https://movies-api.example.com/';
  }

  async getMovie(id) {
    // Send a GET request to the specified endpoint
    return this.get(`movies/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`);
  }

  async getMostViewedMovies(limit = 10) {
    const data = await this.get('movies', {
      // Query parameters
      per_page: limit,
      order_by: 'most_viewed',
    });
    return data.results;
  }
}
```

2: Use **resolvers** to populate the data for every field in the schema. You call **Data Sources** to return the data for the resolvers. These resolvers are used by the front end to fill their query schemas
## Client

- Fetch GraphQL data with `useQuery` hook (think `useState` where a query is called upon loading)

1: First define a GraphQL Query (done within the same file that front end component exists in).

```javascript
// index.js
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  query GetDogs {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;
```

2: Pass the query to the `UseQuery` hook inside of a component

```js
// index.js
function Dogs({ onDogSelected }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);

  if (loading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <select name='dog' onChange={onDogSelected}>
      {data.dogs.map((dog) => (
        <option key={dog.id} value={dog.breed}>
          {dog.breed}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```
